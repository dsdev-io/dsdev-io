## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install`,
start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy the project, you may need to install an
> [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters)
> for your target environment.
